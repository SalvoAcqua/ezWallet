# Project Estimation - CURRENT

Version: V1

# Estimation approach

Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course

# Estimate by size

| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                       | 5        |

| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    | 30       |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     | 900      |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 1 day    |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|                                    | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- |:----------------:|:------------------:|
| estimate by size                   | 30               | 1 day              |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 45               | 1,5 day            |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 54               | 2 days             |

The differences between the estimations can be explained by :

- Estimation by size doesn't consider the time of reflection/ design

- Behind a report or product, there are multiple activities that need time to be
  completed.
