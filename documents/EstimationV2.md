# Estimation approach

Consider the EZWallet  project in FUTURE version (as proposed by the team), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course

# Estimate by size

| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                       | 12       |

| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    | 96       |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     | 2880     |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 3 days   |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|                                    | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- |:----------------:|:------------------:|
| estimate by size                   | 96               | 3 days             |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 170              | 6 days             |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 178              | 6 days             |

The differences between the estimations can be explained by :

- Estimation by size doesn't consider the time of reflection/ design

- Behind a report or product, there are multiple activities that need time to be
  completed.
